## Key Features of DXF Manipulation

DXF Manipulation is a powerful tool designed to **convert JSON to DXF/DWG** with precision and efficiency. Here’s what makes it stand out:

### ✅ **JSON to DXF/DWG Conversion**

- Convert structured **JSON data** into **DXF/DWG files**.
- Maintain precise CAD entity attributes from JSON definitions.
- Supports exporting to multiple **DXF versions** for compatibility.

### ✅ **Supports Essential DXF/DWG Entities**

- **Lines, Circles, Arcs, Polylines, and Splines**
- **Text, MText (Multiline Text)**
- **Blocks & Insertions**
- **Layers and Linetypes**
- **Dimensions and Annotations**

### ✅ **Seamless DWG Support**

- Generate both **DXF and DWG** files, allowing flexibility in CAD workflows.
- Ensures **compatibility with AutoCAD and other CAD software**.

### ✅ **Built on ACadSharp**

- Uses **ACadSharp** for high-accuracy DXF and DWG handling.
- Provides a **robust API** to extend and customize CAD exports.

### ✅ **Automatic Entity Mapping**

- Convert **structured JSON objects** directly into DXF entities.
- Supports **nested structures** for complex drawings.

### ✅ **Customizable Metadata**

- Assign custom properties such as:
  - **Layers**
  - **Colors**
  - **Line types**
  - **Text styles**
  - **Block definitions**

### ✅ **Cross-Platform & Lightweight**

- Works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
- Minimal dependencies, making it **easy to integrate into any project**.
