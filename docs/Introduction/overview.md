# Overview

## What is DXF Manipulation?

**DXF Manipulation** is a tool designed to generate DXF and DWG files from structured JSON data. It enables developers and engineers to programmatically create CAD drawings without manual interaction with CAD software. Built on **ACadSharp**, it ensures high compatibility with DXF and DWG formats.

## Why Use DXF Manipulation?

### ✅ **Convert JSON to DXF/DWG**

Easily generate DXF and DWG files from structured JSON data, allowing seamless CAD automation.

### ✅ **Programmatic Drawing Creation**

Define CAD entities in JSON and export them into DXF/DWG files without using a CAD interface.

### ✅ **DWG Support**

Supports both DXF and DWG formats, making it a versatile tool for CAD workflows.

### ✅ **Built on ACadSharp**

Leverages **ACadSharp** to ensure precision and compatibility with AutoCAD standards.
